if the GATT connection doesn't works can be for three reasons



1. The device has not been found...

--> This can be by Random MAC security method from BLE devices.

2. The device rejected the GATT connection...

--> There are devices can reject GATT connections by last security method or because use PIN but you dont have to worry if L2CAP connection connects but you need a PIN dont worry GATT commands
later gonna help you, take in mind that L2CAP test connect its to check if you can extract de GATT data knowing if you can comm with device.

Mostly of BLE devices doesnt require PIN because are foccused like periphericals but sometimes there are devices that can have BLE/BR stack at the same time on the same device.

And other times can be a master device so there you maybe need the PIN but on general BLE devices doesnt require...

3. The device is not BLE...

--> Obvius thing but we have to say, if device doesnt have GATT protocol on his stack because its BC/BR/ that use RFCOMM stack dont gonnar work.
